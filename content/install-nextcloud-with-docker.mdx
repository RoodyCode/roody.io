Nextcloud is a popular open-source self-hosted cloud storage and file synchronization solution. With Docker and Docker Compose, you can easily set up Nextcloud on your server while optimizing it for maximum performance. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Nextcloud using Docker Compose, with a docker-compose.yml file optimized for performance. This installation method is also compatible with Raspberry Pi devices.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose installed on your system

## Step 1: Create the Docker Compose File

Create a new file named docker-compose.yml and open it in a text editor. Paste the following content into the file:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

networks:
  nextcloud-net:
    name: nextcloud-net
    external: false
volumes:
  nextcloud:
  nextcloud-db:
  nextcloud-redis:
services:
  nextcloud-redis: # Redis
    container_name: nextcloud-redis
    image: redis:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - nextcloud-redis:/var/lib/redis
    command: redis-server --requirepass YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD
    networks:
      - nextcloud-net
  nextcloud-db: # MariaDB
    container_name: nextcloud-db
    image: mariadb:latest
    restart: always
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW --innodb-file-per-table=1 --skip-innodb-read-only-compressed
    volumes:
      - nextcloud-db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
    networks:
      - nextcloud-net
  nextcloud: # Nextcloud
    container_name: nextcloud
    image: nextcloud:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_HOST=nextcloud-db
      - PHP_UPLOAD_LIMIT=0
      - PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=8G
      - REDIS_HOST=nextcloud-redis
      - REDIS_HOST_PASSWORD=YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD
    networks:
      - nextcloud-net
```

Make sure to replace YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD and YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD with secure passwords of your choice. These passwords will be used for the Redis and MariaDB services.

## Step 2: Start the Nextcloud Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the docker-compose.yml file. Run the following command to start the Nextcloud installation:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will download the required Docker images and start the Nextcloud, MariaDB, and Redis containers in the background.

## Step 3: Access Nextcloud

Once the containers are up and running, you can access Nextcloud by opening a web browser and entering the following URL:

`http://YOUR_IP_OR_DOMAIN:8080`

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Nextcloud using Docker Compose with an optimized configuration for maximum performance. Docker simplifies the deployment and management of Nextcloud, allowing you to focus on securely accessing and sharing your files. Remember to follow best practices for data backup and security to ensure the safety of your Nextcloud installation. Enjoy your self-hosted cloud storage and collaboration platform!
